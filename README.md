This repository contains the production scripts, sample data, and classifier construction .py file for the implementation of an end-to-end ML pipeline at Mayo Clinic.

BACKGROUND:
When patients seek out radiation therapy (RT) for the treatment of cancer, a crucial piece of medical information for the radiation oncology department is whether or not said patient has received prior radiation therapy. Considerations of cumulative radiation exposure, site-based side effects and professional practices, etc. all affect the ways in which Mayo prescribes their own courses of radiation therapy. Unfortunately, because many patients don't possess their complete medical history and it can be hard to obtain that information from other facilities (since Mayo sees patients from all over the world), the best resource Mayo often has to assess whether a patient has received prior radiation comes from the clinical notes taken by various medical professionals during patient interviews, which are stored as inconsistently-formatted text in Mayo's main patient QuerySpace.

As such, if a patient's past medical records are not available, a team of human reviewers at Mayo reads through the clinical notes looking for evidence of prior radiation. The team achieves approximately a 92% accuracy rate in reviewing the text (which is contextually-excellent in the medical field), but obviously this process is slow and costly. The goal of this project is to build a scalable supervised ML classifying estimator which, based on the content of a patient's clinical notes, can rapidly classify that patient as prior RT/no prior RT with a higher level of accuracy than is currently being achieved by the human-review team.
